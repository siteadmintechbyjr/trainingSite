<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the Tech by JR Training site.  This site has been designed for you to easily
   learn new tasks and become a better asset to yourself by enhancing your capabilities
   and to the company as you learn more and expand the projects you can complete.  When attempting to learn
   it is recommended for you to start at the
   <a href="/jekyll/update/2018/12/04/what-is-a-computer.html">What is a computer</a> post to gain the best understanding
   of the content that is being provided to you.
   You can jump from post to post by going to the <a href="/subjects/">
     Subjects</a> page, however, this will cause an issue for you as all subjects build off the last.
</p>

   features
   that will make all of your hard work and effort worth while as you will have a presentable finished product
   after you have finished a subject.
