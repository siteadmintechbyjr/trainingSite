<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well if you've made it this far then your intention is to truly learn about the current page you are on.
   This site was designed to provide an environment in which all information pertaining to a certain subject can easily be reviewed and
  utilized for productivity.  What this means is that if you intend on learning about hardware as a subject there are a number of
  subcategories in which you would be able to review.  As of right now we only have the current subject of hardware.  We will eventually
  have software subjects which will easily teach things such as operating systems and applications usage and simple design.
